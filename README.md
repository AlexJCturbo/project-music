## Description

This one is a project. Unlike Challenges it's a colab team work/effort on this one. Each team is tasked with creating a site using 2 APIs, modals instead of pop-ups and such, and html/css/java frameworks "other than bootstrap".

- We ended up deciding upon a music recommendations related product named (N/A). that would have ppl search for music per genre and then be recommanded for similar music of their liking. (submission version may or may not include features like lyrical descriptions, etc. currently...)

## Code Descriptions

We decided to use ([MATERIAL UI](https://mui.com/)/[SEMANTIC UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)/[Threejs](https://threejs.org/)/--) for framework "other than Bootstrap". And the APIs are ([Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)/[Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/)/[MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API)/[Songstats](https://rapidapi.com/songstats-app-songstats-app-default/api/songstats/)/--)
